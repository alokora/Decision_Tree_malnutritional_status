# Decision_Tree_malnutritional_status
We have used a decision tree to predict malnutrition in children in rural populations.
Here is the visual decision tree based on categorical data. You can read more about decision trees [(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decision-tree/)].

# Features used
The main algorithm which is used is ID3 with the following features:

Information gain based on entropy

Information gain based on Gini

Some pruning capabilities like:
-Minimum number of samples
-Minimum information gain

The resulting tree is not a binary tree.
