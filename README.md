# Decision_Tree_malnutritional_status
We have used a decision tree to predict malnutrition in children in rural populations.
# Features used
The main algorithm which is used is ID3 with the following features:

Information gain based on entropy
Information gain based on Gini

Some pruning capabilities like:
-Minimum number of samples
-Minimum information gain

The resulting tree is not a binary tree.
